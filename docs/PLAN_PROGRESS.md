# Progressive Commitment Harness - Stage Progress Marker

This is the tracked progress copy of `docs/PLAN.md`.

Purpose:

- keep the canonical staged plan stable in `docs/PLAN.md`;
- record which sprint advanced which stage, task, and feature;
- make the next sprint visible in Git without committing local coordinator instructions.

Coordinator rule: Collin plans, dispatches, reviews, integrates, and updates docs. Feature code is delegated to worker agents.

## Current Marker

Updated: 2026-06-29

Latest integrated code before this progress update: `b20ca29b47ca840e1108eeab0ed5a232eff653c5`

Overall position: Stage 2/3 now have a deterministic provider-free session loop and golden packet corpus. The UI has a publishable interaction seam but is not yet wired to real harness endpoints. Stage 5/6 have provider-local model-action eval scaffolding, but no true live small-model bake-off has run yet.

## Sprint Ledger

| Sprint | Stage(s) advanced | Task | Feature/result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 001 | Stage 0 | Scaffold, build, publish path | Blazor app, TypeScript build, .NET solution, GitHub remote publish, SSH fix | done |
| 001 | Stage 1 | Core contracts | `Pch.Core` internal state contracts, model-facing DTOs, ledgers, authority policy, closed harness action shapes | first pass done, not frozen |
| 001 | Stage 2 | Projection skeleton | `Pch.Harness` projection service with stable fixture packet and bounded synthetic 1/7/14 day projections | started |
| 001 | Stage 3 | Stage machine and approval gates | in-memory trip session, deterministic stage-machine skeleton, approval gate that blocks commit/spend without token | started |
| 001 | UI feasibility gate | UI proof surface | Blazor/TypeScript Stage Cockpit fixture with generated form, choice cards, approval gate, and evidence trace preview | done as fixture |
| 001 | Stage 7 groundwork | Provider gateway | `Pch.Providers` OpenRouter/Qwen client, credit guard, typed provider errors, deterministic mocks, approval-token enforcement for commit adapter | groundwork only |
| 002 | Stage 2 | Golden packet corpus | Provider-free golden packets for slot collection, choice collapse, approval request, conflict review, funeral downtime, and business trip scenarios | done |
| 002 | Stage 3 | Session loop | Deterministic `SessionLoop`, form response handling, candidate selection, defer/handoff recording, explicit blocked results, and approval-token matching against pending approval requests | done for provider-free loop |
| 002 | UI feasibility gate | Interaction seam | Stage Cockpit response seam with pending/applied/rejected/approval-required states, approval/evidence components, preserved candidate/approval ids, and UI smoke markers | done as UI-local seam |
| 002 | Stage 5/6 groundwork | Model-action runner | Provider-local model action runner/evaluator, strict JSON action parsing, deterministic mock, sanitized diagnostics, and no raw model response exposure | groundwork done |

## Sprint 001 Verification

- `dotnet test`: 22 tests passed.
- `dotnet build`: passed, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- `npm run build:ui`: passed.
- UI HTTP smoke: 200, found Stage Cockpit markers.
- `origin/main`: confirmed at `3c9ba1c011ed1caa958198011240ba823b90b7e2`.

## Sprint 002 Target

Sprint 002 turned the fixture skeleton into a deterministic session loop while preserving the worker boundary:

- Stage 2 advanced from synthetic projection to reusable golden packet corpus and bounded packet checks.
- Stage 3 advanced from skeleton to deterministic session traversal for form, choice, approval, defer, handoff, and blocked outcomes.
- The UI feasibility surface gained a local interaction seam and visible response states.
- Stage 5/6 gained provider-local model-action/eval scaffolding with deterministic mocks.

## Sprint 002 Verification

- `dotnet test`: 43 tests passed.
- `dotnet build`: passed, 0 warnings, 0 errors.
- `npm run build:ui`: passed.
- UI HTTP smoke: 200, found `pch-shell`, `Session Response Seam`, and `approval.mock_hold`.
- Repair gates enforced:
  - model action runner no longer exposes raw model response content;
  - disallowed model action errors no longer echo untrusted model output;
  - approval tokens must match a pending approval request in an approval-bearing stage.

## Sprint 003 Target

Sprint 003 should create the first deterministic end-to-end UI run over real harness session services, then run the first small-model action smoke/eval where credits and provider health allow.

- wire the Stage Cockpit to server-side `Pch.Harness` session services instead of UI-only response fixtures;
- freeze the harness action intake boundary enough for provider output mapping;
- run a credit-guarded OpenRouter `qwen/qwen3-14b` smoke/eval against golden packets, with mock-only tests as the default path;
- keep all booking/spend/irreversible behavior approval-gated.

## Not Yet Started

- Stage 4 strong-model planner/expander/auditor.
- Stage 5 true small-model structured generation beyond provider-local scaffolding.
- Stage 6 fidelity bake-off with ownership matrix beyond initial scaffolding.
- Stage 7 real Amadeus availability and pricing adapters.
- Stage 8 day compiler and dependency propagation.
- Stage 9 true end-to-end UI run.
- Stage 10 hardening.
